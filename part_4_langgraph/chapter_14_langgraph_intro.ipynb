    "Build a sophisticated document analysis agent that demonstrates everything\n",
    "you learned in Chapter 14:\n",
    "- State design with TypedDict and Annotated[list, add]\n",
    "- Multiple nodes (at least 6)\n",
    "- Multi-way branching (4+ document types)\n",
    "- Quality-check loops with iteration limits\n",
    "- Debugging support\n",
    "\n",
    "REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "1. Classify documents into 4+ types (technical, business, legal, academic)\n",
    "2. Route to specialized extraction nodes based on type\n",
    "3. Evaluate extraction quality and retry if needed (max 2 retries)\n",
    "4. Accumulate extracted information using Annotated[list, add]\n",
    "5. Include debug output for tracing execution\n",
    "\n",
    "YOUR TASKS:\n",
    "1. Complete the State definition\n",
    "2. Implement all node functions\n",
    "3. Create the routing function\n",
    "4. Build and compile the graph\n",
